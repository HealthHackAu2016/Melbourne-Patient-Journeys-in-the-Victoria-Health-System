# The problem

We would like to visualise the most common patient journeys, accounting for different cohorts of patients. What services do they use, how often do they have contact with providers and how long does it take to complete? How do these journeys differ for patients who live in various areas? For example, is the total journey time for a public patient who needs a hip replacement the same if they live in Sale as it is for a similar patient who lives in East Melbourne? Does the length of time vary depending on the starting locations e.g. different providers, ED presentation vs specialist clinic or by other characteristics such as age, location, gender, disease profile?

# Solution

We would like a prototype web enabled visualisation tool, utilising open source D3.js visualisation libraries and the unit record data supplied by DHHS (most likely .csv formatted files).
